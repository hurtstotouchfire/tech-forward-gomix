Sharing tech-focused organizations and tools working for social progress.

## To do
- [ ] Figure out the timeouts; is there a rate limit on the Google Sheet? If so, can we cache it?
- [ ] Bring over any files we need from Phantom
- [ ] Determine whether we can survive without a build step; if not, move source files into the built CSS files here so we have the originals
- [ ] Tests
- [ ] Redirect domain
- [ ] Redirect old GitHub
- [ ] Hook up a github project for backups
- [ ] Set up Google Forms and properly lock down the spreadsheet
